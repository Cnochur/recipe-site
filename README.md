# recipe-v2
Updated version of the recipe site
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the last time i created a recipe page for The Odin Project I have 
learned a little more about the box model. It really inspired me to not only 
update the site but also re do it entirely from scratch. I am starting on it 
as i finish this page.

Goals:

- Display good knowledge of the box model.
    - Proper Use of margins, paddings and borders

- Use git to the best i can

Update 1...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


So far i have choosen the final elmements for the index page. I have also
implemented the final positioning for now. I feel I have gotten a better grasp 
of the box model but I know there is a lot more to learn, and I am excited. 

I have also discovered containers. I do not fully understand them yet.

The next steps:

- Work on template for recipe pages.
- Add images to index
    - logo
    - food x4

I will maybe do more work later on today or tomorrow.

Update 2...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Between yesterday (30/10/23) and today i have completed the final draft of the 
index page. I have incorperated a logo, which i designed, and a color 
board for the site. I have also created a template for the recipe pages
The previous tasks have been completed and the next few tasks are as follows:

- Complete the design of the recipe template.
- Get each recipe page complete.
    - Images
    - ingredients
    - methods
    - descriptions
- Link the pages together.

I also need to link the font to the pages as i have not yet done this.

I have completed the site to the best of my ability as of now. 

I am happy overall with the progress that i have made so far. After a few 
down days i am now back on track and ready to get stuck in to The Odin
project again. 

Thanks,
