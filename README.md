# recipe-v2
Updated version of the recipe site
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the last time i created a recipe page for The Odin Project I have 
learned a little more about the box model. It really inspired me to not only 
update the site but also re do it entirely from scratch. I am starting on it 
as i finish this page.

Goals:

- Display good knowledge of the box model.
    - Proper Use of margins, paddings and borders

- Use git to the best i can

Update 1...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


So far i have choosen the final elmements for the index page. I have also
implemented the final positioning for now. I feel I have gotten a better grasp 
of the box model but I know there is a lot more to learn, and I am excited. 

I have also discovered containers. I do not fully understand them yet.

The next steps:

- Work on template for recipe pages.
- Add images to index
    - logo
    - food x4

I will maybe do more work later on today or tomorrow.
