# recipe-v2
Updated version of the recipe site
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the last time i created a recipe page for The Odin Project I have 
learned a little more about the box model. It really inspired me to not only 
update the site but also re do it entirely from scratch. I am starting on it 
as i finish this page.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goals:

- Display good knowledge of the box model.
    - Proper Use of margins, paddings and borders

- Use git to the best i can
